# RansomwareDetection
This project simulates an early-warning system that detects ransomware indicators and visualizes system threat levels through an interactive web interface.
This project demonstrates how early anomaly detection and entropy analysis can be used to identify potential ransomware activity before large-scale encryption occurs.

It is designed as a hackathon prototype to showcase real-time cybersecurity monitoring and visualization.
